  title={Slipping Control Algorithms for Object Manipulation with Sensorized Parallel Grippers},

  volume={},

  pages={7455-7461},
  abstract={Parallel jaw grippers have a limited dexterity, however they can still be used for in-hand manipulation tasks, such as pivoting or other controlled sliding motions of the grasped object. A rotational sliding maneuver is challenging since the grasped object can easily slip if the grip force is not properly adjusted to allow rotational sliding while avoiding translational sliding at the same time. This paper has a twofold aim. First, it intends to refine control algorithms to avoid both rotational and linear slippage, already presented by the authors, by proposing a novel sliding motion model that leads to a grip force as small as possible to avoid slippage, so as to enlarge the set of fragile and deformable objects that can be safely grasped with this approach. Second, the paper exploits the motion model to set up a new algorithm for controlled rotational sliding, thus enabling challenging in-hand manipulation actions. All control algorithms are sensor-based, exploiting a sensorized gripper equipped with a six-axis force/tactile sensor, which provides contact force and torque measurements as well as orientation of the object with respect to the gripper. A set of experiments are executed on a Kuka iiwa showing how the proposed control algorithms are effective to both avoid slippage and allow a controlled sliding motion.},

abstract = {Control of robots manipulating objects using only the sense of touch is a challenge. In-hand motion of the manipulated object highly depends on the friction forces acting at the contact surfaces. Soft contacts allow torsional frictions as well as friction forces, therefore robots can perform more complex manipulation abilities, like object pivoting. Control of the pivoting sliding motion is very difficult especially without any visual feedback. The paper proposes a novel method to control the sliding velocity of the object by using a simple parallel gripper endowed with force/tactile sensors only. The strategy is based on a nonlinear observer that estimates the sliding velocity from force/torque measurements and a model of the sliding dynamics.}

abstract = {3D feature-based Visual Servoing (VS) on the one hand shows attractive peculiarities, on the other hand it suffers from drawbacks related to the existence of local minima, which may affect the convergence character of the VS control loop. Furthermore, the performance of the visual tracking module may constitute a bottleneck enforcing severe constraints on the workspace and visual task execution speed. In this paper we introduce a novel sampled-data model of the 3D feature-based VS, and, in order to avoid drawbacks due to local minima, we plan the target reference trajectory in the feature space with the aim to constraint the feature error dynamics to remain close to the desired equilibrium point. Then, we propose a novel feature generation based on the homography provided by a template matching algorithm based on the Zero mean Normalized Cross Correlation (ZNCC) and the design of a visual tracking scheme by resorting to the Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) and Lyapunov direct method, which explicitly takes into account the camera velocity limits, while ensuring stability.}

  abstract={This article describes a set of control algorithms for in-hand object handling using a parallel jaw gripper equipped with force/tactile sensors. The control strategy is model based and relies upon the limit surface concept. The LuGre friction model is combined with the limit surface method to set up a dynamic model of soft contact. The model is exploited to estimate the relative velocity of the object with respect to the fingers, so as to control the grip force to counteract possible slipping events due to external disturbances. Force/tactile feedback, the only perception source used by the algorithms, is suitably exploited not only for safe grasping of a variety of objects with uncertain weight and inertial properties, but also for in-hand manipulation actions, like object pivoting or gripper pivoting. Since the algorithm is based on the control of the object velocity, accuracy of the desired object positioning depends on the initial grasp configuration, as well as on the accuracy of the friction model parameters. Such manipulation skills are evaluated in the execution of various pick and place tasks typical of an in-store logistic scenario.},

Supermarkets contain a large variety of objects to be placed on the shelf layers with specific constraints, doing this with a robot is a challenge and requires a high dexterity. However, an integration of reactive grasping control and motion planning can allow robots to perform such tasks even with grippers with limited dexterity. The main contribution of the letter is a novel method for planning manipulation tasks to be executed using a reactive control layer that provides more control modalities, i.e., slipping avoidance and controlled sliding. Experiments with a new force/tactile sensor equipping the gripper of a mobile manipulator show that the approach allows the robot to successfully perform manipulation tasks unfeasible with a standard fixed grasp.},

abstract = "The paper presents a novel strategy to control the instantaneous rotational velocity of a planar slider subject to a soft contact with friction and to external loads, including gravity. The approach is based on a novel model that combines the LuGre dynamic friction model with the limit surface concept for two main reasons. First, the limit surface allows considering both translational and rotational sliding motions. Secondly, the actual friction provided at the contact by the LuGre dynamic model exhibits dependence on the rate of variation of the external loads and, thus, it is worthwhile in dynamic conditions. Slipping control is realized by acting on the friction forces through the normal load so as to stably regulate the velocity of the slider to zero. The control law exploits a nonlinear observer, based on the proposed model, to estimate the instantaneous rotational velocity of the slider, which is used to compute the normal load necessary to ensure a globally asymptotically stable equilibrium of the slider. Experimental results show the effectiveness of the approach in an application of robotic manipulation using an industrial gripper sensorized with force/tactile sensors."

ABSTRACT = {Tactile data perception is of paramount importance in today’s robotics applications. This paper describes the latest design of the tactile sensor developed in our laboratory. Both the hardware and firmware concepts are reported in detail in order to allow the research community the sensor reproduction, also according to their needs. The sensor is based on optoelectronic technology and the pad shape can be adapted to various robotics applications. A flat surface, as the one proposed in this paper, can be well exploited if the object sizes are smaller than the pad and/or the shape recognition is needed, while a domed pad can be used to manipulate bigger objects. Compared to the previous version, the novel tactile sensor has a larger sensing area and a more robust electronic, mechanical and software design that yields less noise and higher flexibility. The proposed design exploits standard PCB manufacturing processes and advanced but now commercial 3D printing processes for the realization of all components. A GitHub repository has been prepared with all files needed to allow the reproduction of the sensor for the interested reader. The whole sensor has been tested with a maximum load equal to 15N, by showing a sensitivity equal to 0.018V/N. Moreover, a complete and detailed characterization for the single taxel and the whole pad is reported to show the potentialities of the sensor also in terms of response time, repeatability, hysteresis and signal to noise ratio.},

abstract = {Robotic manipulation of objects using the sole tactile feedback is a challenge. If the contact between the robot end effector and the manipulated object is distributed, the robot can exchange both friction forces and torques with it. The friction highly influences the motion of the object. By controlling the friction it is possible to perform complex manipulation tasks, such as moving the object with respect to the end effector by executing a controlled sliding motion. If the motion is a rotation with respect to the end effector, the corresponding maneuver is called pivoting. Control of the pivoting motion is considerably difficult, especially without any visual feedback. This paper proposes a novel method to regulate the object angular position, by means of a pivoting maneuver, through a parallel gripper endowed with force/tactile sensors. The strategy is based on a novel nonlinear observer that estimates the sliding velocity from force/torque measurements and a model of the sliding dynamics. We exploit the Limit Surface concept and the LuGre friction model to build a dynamic model of a planar slider. We show, through experimental results, that simple parallel grippers are able to execute such maneuvers that correspond to adding a virtual joint between the fingers, thus enlarging the robot workspace.}

ABSTRACT={Modern scenarios in robotics involve human-robot collaboration or robot-robot cooperation in unstructured environments. In human-robot collaboration, the objective is to relieve humans from repetitive and wearing tasks. This is the case of a retail store, where the robot could help a clerk to refill a shelf or an elderly customer to pick an item from an uncomfortable location. In robot-robot cooperation, automated logistics scenarios, such as warehouses, distribution centers and supermarkets, often require repetitive and sequential pick and place tasks that can be executed more efficiently by exchanging objects between robots, provided that they are endowed with object handover ability. Use of a robot for passing objects is justified only if the handover operation is sufficiently intuitive for the involved humans, fluid and natural, with a speed comparable to that typical of a human-human object exchange. The approach proposed in this paper strongly relies on visual and haptic perception combined with suitable algorithms for controlling both robot motion, to allow the robot to adapt to human behavior, and grip force, to ensure a safe handover. The control strategy combines model-based reactive control methods with an event-driven state machine encoding a human-inspired behavior during a handover task, which involves both linear and torsional loads, without requiring explicit learning from human demonstration. Experiments in a supermarket-like environment with humans and robots communicating only through haptic cues demonstrate the relevance of force/tactile feedback in accomplishing handover operations in a collaborative task.}

TITLE = {Experimental Comparison of Two 6D Pose Estimation Algorithms in Robotic Fruit-Picking Tasks},

ABSTRACT = {This paper presents an experimental comparison between two existing methods representative of two categories of 6D pose estimation algorithms nowadays commonly used in the robotics community. The first category includes purely deep learning methods, while the second one includes hybrid approaches combining learning pipelines and geometric reasoning. The hybrid method considered in this paper is a pipeline of an instance-level deep neural network based on RGB data only and a geometric pose refinement algorithm based on the availability of the depth map and the CAD model of the target object. Such a method can handle objects whose dimensions differ from those of the CAD. The pure learning method considered in this comparison is DenseFusion, a consolidated state-of-the-art pose estimation algorithm selected because it uses the same input data, namely, RGB image and depth map. The comparison is carried out by testing the success rate of fresh food pick-and-place operations. The fruit-picking scenario has been selected for the comparison because it is challenging due to the high variability of object instances in appearance and dimensions. The experiments carried out with apples and limes show that the hybrid method outperforms the pure learning one in terms of accuracy, thus allowing the pick-and-place operation of fruits with a higher success rate. An extensive discussion is also presented to help the robotics community select the category of 6D pose estimation algorithms most suitable to the specific application.},

NUMBER = {6},

ABSTRACT = {This research article tackles the control problem of an inverted pendulum, also known as the Furuta pendulum, mounted on a velocity-controlled robot manipulator in two configurations: the rotary pendulum and the translational pendulum. Differently from most of the existing control architectures where the motor actuating the pendulum motion is torque-controlled, the proposed control architecture exploits the inner velocity loop usually available on industrial robots, thus easing the implementation of an inverted pendulum. Another aspect investigated in this paper and mostly overlooked in the literature is the digital implementation of the control and, specifically, the latency introduced by the digital controller. The proposed control solution explicitly models such effects in the control design phase, improving the closed-loop performance. The additional novelty introduced by this paper is the friction compensation that is essential in the swing-up phase of the inverted pendulum, whereas classical control strategies for the nonlinear swing-up usually neglect this effect, and their solutions lead to control failures in practical systems. This paper presents detailed modeling and experimental identification phases followed by the control design of both the nonlinear swing-up algorithm and the linear stabilization controller, both experimentally validated on a Meca500 robotic arm controlled via an EtherCAT communication protocol by a mini PC featuring a Xenomai real-time operating system. The overall system showcases the potential of high-performance digital control systems in industrial robotic applications.},

abstract="Nowadays, robots are used in the retail market mostly for warehousing, while they could be of great help in different in-store logistics processes as discussed in previous chapters. The present chapter deals with the shelf replenishment task; its execution by a robot requires overcoming of technological and methodological barriers in the handling of single products rather than the boxes containing them. The challenges a robot has to face to replenish a supermarket shelf are all related to manipulation in narrow spaces of products with a large variety of size, shape, weight, and fragility. The solution proposed by REFILLS is based on a robotic system where perception is used at all hierarchical levels of the control architecture, from high-level task planning algorithms and motion planning to reactive control layers based on physics models, where tactile and visual perception are combined to achieve highly reliable manipulation of items. Experiments in an emulated supermarket shelf are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.",
